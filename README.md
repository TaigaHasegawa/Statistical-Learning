# STAT432 Statistical Learning 

### Objective

Topics in supervised and unsupervised learning are covered, including logistic regression, support vector machines, classification trees and nonparametric regression. Model building and feature selection are discussed for these techniques, with a focus on regularization methods, such as lasso and ridge regression, and methods for model selection and assessment using cross validation. Cluster analysis and principal components analysis are introduced for unsupervised learning.
